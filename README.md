Arcane Audio-Visual Computations
==========
(Work in progress...)

Proof of concept for InnovAnon's Human Programming Technology;
a tool for accelerating alchemical works.

The core functionality will be a myriad apps for modeling, viewing and
controlling complex (and often cyclical) data.
Transposing a harmonic structure (i.e., song) should be as simple as
turning a dial.
There should also be ways for comparing harmonic structures,
such as the differences between scales and chords
under different tuning systems.

The goal is to provide high level descriptions of music, graphical layouts,
lyrics, etc., and to generate sounds and visuals satisfying the constraints.
And to use known spiritual technologies to enhancs or replace rigorous
sadhanas with a form of worship better suited to the Western lifestyle:
relatively instant results, presented in a gamified fashion so its fun.
Bald eagles and cheeseburgers!

Currently, the implementation of song meter involves a combination
of cadences (binary sequences specifying whether one thing is the same
as or different than another) and hash functions (to implement repetition
of motifs... i.e., a section cadence may specify that first and second
phrases differ from each other, but rather than generating a unique
phrase cadence for the second one, it might reuse a phrase cadence 
from elsewhere in the piece).

TODO
----------
- binaural beats
- isochronic pulses (including graphics)
- monaural beats
- other effects... like phasing
- poetic meter

Underlying Concepts
----------
- graphics based on sacred geometry
- automatic management of aesthetics:
  - color schemes
  - layouts
  - balancing circular vs angular geometries
  - animation speeds and types
- management of tick speeds, including sample rate and frame rate
- exploring in a reasonable way
  the vast harmonic space made possible by the combination of:
  - just intonation
  - exotic modes
- synchronization of:
  - implied isochronic pulse caused by polyrhythms
  - acoustic beat (i.e., monaural beat) caused by polytonic harmonies
  - color palette (colors selected as a function of base frequency and scale)
  - tempo
- fractals
- tuning the yellow bell: how to select solfeggio frequencies
  (i.e., base frequencies), scales and modes.
- computing from the ground up with a good college try given to abandoning
  musical tradition while maintaining an awareness of it...
  in other words, traditional structures in Western and Eastern music
  should be reduced to a collection of presets.
  Ultimately, it should break free from the preset scale length of 12
  notes, instead deriving scale lengths using the harmonic variation of
  Euclid's algorithm.

Project Name
----------
HafrenHaver (verb):

To go on and on about a legendary British princess who was drowned
in the River Severn by her repudiated stepmother Gwendolen.

Credits
----------
The lionshare of the credit goes to that inner monologue
that gives voice to subtle and vague impressions from the
subconscious mind-brain (yeah... "mind-brain") or perhaps a
supernatural entity that nobody has actually seen.
Thanks InnovAnon!

Honorable mention to known Western code monks:
- Terry A. Davis
- Sasha Gallagher

Other credits are specifically linked in the source,
such as StackOverflow threads where the good people ensured
forward progress, even on days when I watched several sunrises.

License
----------
If we wrote it, then you own it:
we write technology that no one should have,
and release it to the public domain...
one sinister line at a time.

Other code, obviously, retains the original licenses.
